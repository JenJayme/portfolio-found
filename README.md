This site was built after Berkeley Coding Boot Camp, when I needed a professional-looking portfolio for my job search, after building three previous versions.  By this version, I had a better sense of the brand and style I wanted to convey, and a few more polished projects to showcase.  For expediency, I decided to use the Foundation CSS framework for this version and a simple HTML + CSS structure.

You can see the evolution of my portfolio by glimpsing [earlier versions](#earlier).  It was the very first Javascript assignment, created early in the course, and earlier versions didn't function properly.  Amazing to see how much was learned in a few months since this was first written.

## <a id="earlier">Earlier Versions</a>
The first three versions of my portfolio experimented with various technologies and CSS frameworks.  You can see those and the evolution of my portfolio style by browsing the links below.
### Version 1
This first version was created in the first weeks of the Boot Camp, before we had any code projects to showcase.  The assignment was to replicate a basic format given to us, while learning to use CSS.  It includes placeholder images without links to actual  deployed projects.

* [Version 1 Deployed](https://jenjayme.github.io/portfolio/)

### Version 2
This version was a big upgrade over the first version, and I continued to use and update it after Boot Camp.  Version 2 uses  simple Javascript, jQuery and Bootstrap, and features links to deployed code projects.

* [Version 2 Deployed](https://jenjayme.github.io/responsive-portfolio/)

### Version 3
This version was my favorite stylistically... until all of the image links broke irreparably upon deployment.  I had saved all images in the public folder, and learned it was better practice to keep images with their respective components when building a React app.
